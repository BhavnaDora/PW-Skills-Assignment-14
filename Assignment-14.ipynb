    "##### Multiprocessing is the ability of the system to run more than one processes in parallel. Applications in a multiprocessing system are broken down into smaller routines that run independently. Each process is allocated to the processor by the os.\n",
    "##### Multiprocessing is useful because if we have a computer with single processor and assign it many processes, then it will have to interrupt the previous task and move to another to keep all the processes going. So, multiprocessing helps to perform several tasks at the same time without interruption. Multiple processes run easily thereby reducing the latency of the program."
